# EZ-Shift

## Description

`EZ-Shift` is designed to be an online platform that allows users to transfer their music playlists from one platform to another. It is available both as a website and as a mobile application. The website version can be accessed through a web browser on various devices, while the app version can be downloaded and installed on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

### Features

- **Convertor:** Converts a playlist from one platform to another


### What I Learned

Throughout the development of `EZ-Shift`, several valuable lessons were learned:

- **OAuth:**

- **User Authenication:**

- **Authorization Code Flow:** is suitable for long-running applications in which the user grants permission only once

- **Troubleshooting APIs:** I was able to leverage the data between three API's and take their data to create an object with common attributes

- **Environment Variables:**

- **Dynamically generating / populating html elements:**

- **Redirect URIs:**

## Compiling

Using any modern browser, you can access it from this [website](https://mafalana.github.io/EZ-Shift/)


## Future Improvements

`EZ-Shift` has a lot of potential for further enhancements and features. Here are some ideas for future improvements:

### Bugs

- **Error/Exception Handling:**

- **Wrong Songs:** When converting a playlist to YouTube it may get the instrumental of a song instead of the actual one

### Improvements

- **Compatability with other platforms:**: Like Pandora, Amazon, Soundcloud, and Tidal

- **Previews:** Previewing songs and/or playlists

- **Share Links:** Generate a link to share with friends

- **Mobile App:**
